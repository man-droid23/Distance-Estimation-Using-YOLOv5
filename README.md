# Distance-Estimation-Using-YOLOv5
A simple Distance Estimation of object and camera using distance estimation formula and Yolov5. The formula calculate the estimated distance to an object based on its known size, the focal length of the camera lens, and the pixel width of the object in the image captured by the camera.
